# The Holy Bible: Abridged Beyond the Point of Usefulness

## Genesis 
God made everything, but humans keep screwing it up; some Jews move to Egypt, which seemed like a good idea at the time. 

## Exodus 
Pharaoh tried to kill the Hebrews, but he blew it, so they left, and then everyone accidentally worshipped a cow. 

## Leviticus 
Rules: Don't screw up your sacrifices, don't have weird sex, be nice to your slaves, and once a year send a goat into the desert because, hey, you haven't been so great. 

## Numbers 
People talk smack about God and get punished, then people talk smack about Moses and get punished, then Moses refuses to talk to a rock and gets punished; Hebrews kill their way into the promised land. 

## Deuteronomy 
Moses makes a big list of what you aren't allowed to do, then up and dies on everyone. 

## Joshua 
Joshua and the Israelites kill, enslave, and conquer a bunch of people, at which point Joshua gives a lecture on the importance of rule-following. 

## Judges 
The Israelites keep mucking things up in the Promised land, though they had some solid judges there for a while. 

## Ruth 
Ruth's husband dies, so she moves in with her mother-in-law. Later, she meets a nice man in a wheat field, so it all works out. 

## 1 Samuel 
The Philistines take the Ark of the Covenant, but it doesn't work, so they send it back. Saul becomes king and defeats them, but makes God mad. So, David takes over as king, and you know he's good because one time he killed a HUGE guy with a rock. 

## 2 Samuel 
David kills a bunch of people, which is great, but then he sleeps with a married woman, and WOW is God mad about that. On the plus side, they have a kid named Solomon. 

## 1 Kings 
David is dying and his son Solomon takes over. David tells Solomon to be good to God, which is a little insulting considering how Solomon was conceived. Anyway, the kingdom splits in two even though Solomon built a nice temple and everything. 

## 2 Kings 
The northern chunk of the kingdom gets conquered for being bad. The southern chunk people feel pretty self-righteous about it, but then the same thing happens to them. 

## 1 Chronicles 
Hold on, back up. Remember David from earlier? Really good king. Anyway, sorry to interrupt. Continue. 

## 2 Chronicles 
The Northern kingdom crapped out and got conquered, so let's focus on the Southern Kingdom, which also crapped out and got conquered. Everyone moves to Jerusalem, which seemed like a good idea at the time. 

## Ezra 
The Israelites spend 20 years building a temple, then celebrate by eating crackers. Later, they decide some of their wives and children are a little too pagan, so they pack them off and start looking for nice Jewish girls. 

## Nehemiah 
Nehemiah builds a wall around Jerusalem for cheap by getting each guy to make some wall behind his house. Later, Jewish men start getting with pagans again. 

## Esther 
Esther marries the Persian king. Normally, this would be bad on the "no marrying outside the faith" front, but it all works out when she can get a guy hung for trying to kill all the Jews. 

## Job 
The devil bets God that Job is only faithful because his life is good. God makes Job sick, ruins his farm, and kills his family. Later, Job is miffed, so God scolds him. 

## Psalms 
‚ô´ God is great! God is great! Super great! ‚ô¨  
‚ô´ Couple times he really let things go to hell, BUT ‚ô™  
‚ô¨ that's probably 'cause of something we did, SO ‚ô©  
ùÖ† God is great! God is great! Super great! ‚ô´ 

## Proverbs 
DO do good stuff. DON'T do bad stuff. And for God's sake, LISTEN every now and then. 

## Ecclesiastes 
The great wise man and king, Koheleth, wants you to know that he has literally had every pleasure desire-able, but he still has a lot of complaints. 

## Song of Solomon 
Interlude: A sexy poem, with romantic talk, such as "Your teeth are like a flock of uniformly shaped ewes." 
No, wait WAIT. It's not about sex, it's about loving God. Phew. 

## Isaiah 
Things are going right to Hell in Judea. Isaiah declares that Jerusalem will not fall, but hedges his bets a little by not attaching a time stamp to that. Similarly, he says that at some point the Messiah will come. 

## Jeremiah 
Jeremiah keeps saying Jerusalem will fall to the Babylonians. Eventually, people get mad and throw him in a water tank, which tells you something about the quality of sanitation back then. Later, Jerusalem falls to the Babylonians. 

## Lamentations 
Interlude: Some sad songs about how God was right to let the Babylonians siege, starve, and destroy Jerusalem. We don't have the musical score, but hopefully it was upbeat. 

## Ezekiel 
God tells Ezekiel to tell the Israelites that it's their fault Jerusalem got destroyed, but he'll get them a nicer town later, okay? 

## Daniel 
Daniel is touched by God with the gift of prophecy, which means he gets a pretty solid gig working for the new king. It goes pretty well except for the time he gets thrown in a furnace and the time he gets thrown in a lion pit, but jobs were tougher back then. 

## Hosea 
God orders Hosea to marry an unfaithful harlot, so he does. She cheats on him. He decides the whole thing is an elaborate metaphor for Israel's faithless relationship with God.  
Hey, whatever gets you through the night. 

## Joel 
During a plague of locusts, Joel prophesies that the locusts are the army of God. And, if the people of Israel will repent, they will receive great rewards, like an end to the locusts. 

## Amos 
Amos becomes, like, the 14,000th prophet to note that Israel is making God mad and when you make God mad things go bad. 

## Obadiah 
Edom is ruled as a vassal state of Israel for many years. Later, when the Babylonians attacks Jerusalem, the Edomites don't help fight them off. For this, prophecies Obadiah, they will be punished. 

## Jonah 
Jonah doesn't want to be a prophet, so God has him eaten by a whale. At this point, Jonah changes his mind and God has the whale puke him up. Jonah cooperates, but remains irritated. 

## Micah 
Having enjoyed that story about a whale, we return to another book about a prophet who says doom is coming to Israel. 

## Nahum 
For variety's sake, Nahum prophesies the doom of Nineveh. 

## Habakkuk 
Habakkuk, in a stroke of wild creative genius, prophesies doom for the faithless. 

## Zephaniah 
Zephaniah - presumably giving in to peer pressure among the prophet crowd - prophesies doom for the faithless. 

## Haggai 
Haggai prophesies that everyone better hurry up and build the temple, or bad stuff will happen in Israel. Change that "or" to "and," and he was 100% correct. 

## Zechariah 
Fast forward a few years. Israel got conquered, then unconquered.  
Zechariah tells people to clean up the place so a Messiah can come by. The Messiah will apparently come riding on a donkey, so, they probably don't need to clean too hard. 

## Malachi 
Malachi decries the Israelites for horrible practices, such as sacrificing animals that are not top quality. He prophesies that the Messiah will be courteous and send word before he shows up. 

## Matthew 
Hey, the Messiah's here! He's got a heck of a pedigree, gives a great speech, and this one time they killed him BUT HE CAME RIGHT BACK. 

## Mark 
Basically Matthew's Gospel, but with less boring, more ACTION, and your choice of two endings! 

## Luke 
NO, NO, WAIT, JESUS IS EVEN A BIGGER BADASS THAN IN MARK. This one time they crucified him, and he didn't even NOTICE. 

## John 
Not only are those other three gospels ALL TRUE, but Jesus did so much awesome stuff, John doesn't even have time to list it. Amen! 

## Acts 
Finding the market for Jewish converts to be quite limited, the apostles branch out to gentiles. In the process, Steve gets killed, but it's okay because it gets Paul to convert. Paul does a great job, until the Romans get mad. 

## Romans 
Dear Romans,  
Hey, it's me Paul. Taking a trip to Spain, but I'm planning to drop by. Make sure to be good, don't be bad, present your body as  
a living holy sacrifice, etc. Also, wouldn't  
mind a little funding for the Spain trip.  
Very Sincerely, Paul 

## 1 Corinthians 
Dear Corinthians,  
CUT IT OUT. CUT IT OUT with the drinking and sex and false gods. Okay? It says right there in the book, Jesus died and came back to life, and THAT GUY says to CUT IT OUT.  
With Irritation, Paul  
PS: No chicks talking in church. 

## 2 Corinthians 
Dear Corinthians,  
Yes, I am the real deal. If you hear someone else talking about some other Jesus, it's not the genuine article.  OKAY? You think I would put up with this crap if God didn't make me do it? Check yourself, Corinth.  
Yours, Paul 

## Galatians 
Dear Galatians,  
I am the only one who talks for God. That's our arrangement, OKAY? If someone else says he's talking for God, he's full of it.  
Very Sincerely, Paul 

## Ephesians 
Dear Ephesians,  
It's me, Paul. I'm writing from jail to give  
you some life advice. Be good, be unified,  
and husbands... love your wives the same way Jesus loved his followers. Only, maybe stick around longer.  
Very Sincerely, Paul 

## Philippians 
Dear Philippians,  
Thank you for your continued support. I can only hope that you too are lucky enough to suffer as much torment as I have, in service of The Lord.  
Christianly, Paul 

## Colossians 
Dear Colossians,  
No, NO, NO. Jesus is the real God. No other Gods. GOT IT? JEEZ.  
Please find the attached notes on living properly, which I also sent to the Ephesians.  
Very Sincerely, Paul 

## 1 Thessalonians 
Dear Thessalonians,  
I apologize for the confusion in this important matter: If you die prior to the coming of God's Kingdom, you are still eligible to enter.  
With this in mind, anyone caught mourning shall be considered lacking in faith. 
Very Sincerely, Paul 

## 2 Thessalonians 
Dear Thessalonians,  
I know, we're all hoping Jesus comes back soon. But, the fact of the matter is that we haven't even seen the anti-Christ yet. So, sit tight, OKAY?  
Very Sincerely, Paul 

## 1 Timothy 
Dear Timothy,  
Some rules for your church: There is exactly one God. Not one, or two, or three. Okay? Also, don't start one of those hippie vegetarian deals. We get mocked enough as it is.  
Yours, Paul 

## 2 Timothy 
Dear Timothy,  
Listen, I got out of jail, but then Nero picked me up, and man, the accommodations here are a lot more dungeon-y. Be good and do good and all that stuff, and would it kill you to visit?  
Yours, Paul 

## Titus 
Dear Titus, 
The main thing with picking leaders for your church is that they're not stupid jerks. This is harder than you'd think.  
As for your flock: have them be good, and  
don't let the old ladies hit the liquor too hard.  
Very Sincerely, Paul 

## Philemon 
Dear Philemon,  
I'm sending back your slave Onesimus with this letter. Please cut him some slack for running away. Of course, it's your choice how to handle that.  
Thanks for the funding, and have a great day!  
Timothy and Paul 

## Hebrews 
Dear Hebrews,  
JESUS IS THE BEST! JESUS IS IMMUTABLE! BETTER THAN MOSES! BETTER THAN A REALLY SWEET SWORD!  
-Anonymous 

## James 
To Whom It May Concern,  
I don't care what any other letters say! For  
God's sake, get off your ass and help people!  
Sincerely, James 

## 1 Peter 
To Whom It May Concern,  
You know what? People talk smack about Christians all day. I don't even care. That's just the Christian life, I guess. Whatever.  
But, let's not rile up the Romans too much. Okay, guys?  
Sincerely, Peter 

## 2 Peter 
To Whom It May Concern,  
I know the Second Coming hasn't happened yet. Look, all I can tell you is the date is TBD, but if God shows up and you're worshipping the wrong guy, you're gonna have it pretty rough.  
Sincerely, Peter 

## 1 John 
To Whom It May Concern,  
YES, God REALLY came down and was REALLY made of meat the entire time, and I don't want to catch anyone saying otherwise.  
-JOHN  

## 2 John 
Dear Lady,  
Can you believe these people who think God  
was never in the flesh? They are anti-Christ,  
so don't have any of them over for dinner, all right?  
TTYL, John 

## 3 John 
Dear Gaius,  
I wrote a letter to Diotrephes about how he's preaching everything wrong, and he wouldn't even open the damn thing. What's with these people?  
Talk soon, John 

## Jude 
To Everyone Doing it Right,  
Can you believe these people doing it wrong? You know, there were people in the Old Testament who did it wrong, and we all saw what happened to them.  
Yeah.  
Sincerely, Jude 

## Revelation 
Dear Everyone,  
GUYS. I was on the Island of Patmos, when (WHOA!) an Angel started talking. Then the Angel said, "Write all this down!"  
And he said God's gonna play some trumpets so loud it'll kill a bunch of people. Then angels are gonna drop some big bowls of plagueon Earth and kill a bunch more. Then hail and dragons and so forth, BUT THEN we get a new Jerusalem and sin is abolished.  

## Revelation (Con't) 
Should be any minute now.  
Sincerely, John Island of Patmos, Spring Break, AD 96
